ActsAsFeaturable
====================

This is a plugin that assumes you want to "feature" a specific type of object for a pre-defined amount of time.

You can easily manage featured objects in a admin UI by scaffolding the featured_period object. Of course, you can add methods to your controllers to manage featured periods in a easier/smarter way.

How to use:
-----------

* Create a migration to create the table to hold the featured periods.
 This table holds the information about when and for how long objects are featured in you application.

  def self.up
    create_table "featured_periods", :force => true do |t|
      t.column "featurable_id", :integer
      t.column "featurable_type", :string
      t.column "starts_at", :datetime, :null => false
      t.column "expires_at", :datetime, :null => false
      t.column "created_at", :datetime, :null => false
      t.column "updated_at", :datetime, :null => false
    end
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :featured_periods
  end

== Usage

 * Make your ActiveRecord model act as featurable.

  class Video < ActiveRecord::Base
 	  acts_as_featurable
  end

 * Feature a specific model object

  Call the feature! method to feature an object.

  v = Video.find :first
  v.feature!
  v.featured? => true

  Call the unfeature! method to unfeature an object.

  v.unfeature!
  v.featured? => false

  Models are featured for 1 month by default, but you can pass arguments to the feature! method to change the default behavior.

  v.feature! 3.weeks.from_now
  v.featured? => true

  The Video class also gets a new method called find_featured that you can use to find the featured objects.

  Video.find_featured :first => # Video id: 18, title: "Skyview Tower" ..
